Besides being easy to use, it allows you to use queries to decrease the data usage and increase the security so that you can get just the info you need for your user. When offline, apps remain responsive because the Firebase SDK persists your data to disk, giving the end user an immersive experience.

How do these crash reporters do what they do to make our debugging lives easier? Let‚Äôs find out! In this session, you'll learn how to create a crash reporting SDK from scratch using Android's UncaughtExceptionHandler, starting by capturing and sending stack traces to an HTTP endpoint. We'll then progressively add functionality onto our crash reporter until it's turned into a battle-tested SDK that we're confident will save us hours of debugging crashes in production.<br>\n</p>\n<p>As expected diving deeper into the inner workings of our tools, we‚Äôll encounter challenges along the way. We‚Äôll analyze the various scenarios, what they mean for our apps, and how to best go about solving for them given tradeoffs and solutions. Here are some of the challenges we‚Äôll encounter:<br>\n</p>\n<p>For starters, we‚Äôll discuss the design constraints caused by working in a low-memory environment, and how streaming IO and JSON serialization can help us capture OutOfMemoryErrors. We‚Äôll also learn the best practices of caching undelivered reports on disk for future delivery and triggering automatic upload of reports in response to connectivity changes. We‚Äôll consider privacy issues, like how we can collect useful metadata about the device and application at the time of crash while respecting user privacy by filtering sensitive information. To further expand our tool, we‚Äôll capture exceptions caught in a try-catch block and discuss the difficulties with ensuring thread-safety in these situations. Then we‚Äôll move on to the various strategies for testing a crash reporter and walk through the benefits of black-box end-to-end tests.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Another issue to examine is how we can deobfuscate stack traces in apps which use R8‚Äîwe‚Äôll review uploading a mapping file to an HTTP endpoint and read its contents to reveal a readable stack trace. There are even things we can do to highlight the most useful parts of stack traces as well as thinking through grouping related errors together. Then we‚Äôll consider supporting different API levels and how it affects the collection of useful data, and finally, we‚Äôll touch on capturing errors in NDK apps and the potential pitfalls in the Java Native Interface.<br>\n</p>",

We start by utilizing a design sprint to explore the power of mobile and how it fits into the market/problem we are trying to solve. Then focusing on the crucial step in a design sprint, we build high fidelity prototypes in rapid succession utilizing the JetPack Android software components (UI, Behavior, Foundation, Architecture) to take full advantage of the Android platform.&nbsp;We do this by leveraging the design features of Android Studio (material components/theme editor, constraint library, motion editor) along with open source/industry resources to build an intuitive and beautiful UI.</p>\n<p>Once the UI framework is done, we write the Kotlin application logic utilizing the Android Architecture Components with data binding connected to Firebase for the synchronized backend. With our application finished we execute our strategy for marketing, distribution, and monetization guided by Data-Driven Ethnography (DDE).&nbsp;At the end of the session, the audience will have a good idea of how in rapid secession all these tools and components come together to produce magic.</p>",
