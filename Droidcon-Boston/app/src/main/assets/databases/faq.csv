"How do I get around?","There are many options for getting into the city from the airport. Look for the $5 shuttle to the Back Bay. Even cheaper rides on the MBTA Blue line might work for you.

Lyft and Uber are also allowed to drop-off and pickup from the airport.","","",https://www.massport.com/logan-airport/to-and-from-logan/logan-express/back-bay/
